        <p id = "mp"> The year is 2069, and the physical shipment industry is at an all time low.
            The new era of digital shipping has just begun, and you have setup your new company called Terminal Trading Co.

        <p id = "mp"> Terminal Trading Co. is a game about simple 
        economics accompanied by some simple terminal commands. 
        To get started with the game, type </p>
        <p class = 'green'>start</p>
        <p id = "mp"> into the command bar.</p>

    <div id = "md">
        <p id ="mp">The goal of the game is to get as much money as possible.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class = "large-spacer"></div>
    <div id = "mh">How Do You Earn Money?</div>
    <div class = "divider"></div>
    <div id = "md">
        <p id ="mp">Packages or shipments in the form of: <br><br>[ </p>
        <p class= 'green'>New Package: </p><p class = 'dull'>package_name</p>
        <p id ="mp"> ] <br><br> will come in every 15 to 100 seconds and appear on the terminal display. 
        When a package comes in, it gives you a set amount of money. 
        This is the only way to gain money <strong>directly</strong> in the game.
        <br><br> The intervals between packages arriving is based on the demand meter, </p>
        <p class = 'yellow'>(the yellow percentage)</p>
        <p id ='mp'> The higher the percentage is, the faster you will be able to get package orders, 
        which in turn results in more money.
        <br><br>You can set the money gained when recieving a package by writing: <br><br>[ </p>
        <p class= 'blue'>cost(</p><p class = 'dull'>new_service_cost</p><p class= 'blue'>)</p>
        <p id = 'mp'> ]<br><br></p>
    </div>
    <div class = "large-spacer"></div>
    <div id = "mh">What's the twist?</div>
    <div class = "divider"></div>
    <div id = "md">
        <p id ="mp">While you can earn money by getting these packages, 
        <strong>everything comes at a cost</strong>. 
        You are only the middleman in this service, so you must take the people's orders, and ship it for them. 
        This costs money, but if packages are not shipped it will hurt the demand meter, 
        in turn, making earning money much slower.
        <br><br>You can send packages via: <br><br>[ </p>
        <p class= 'blue'>send(</p><p class = 'dull'>package_name</p><p class= 'blue'>)</p>
        <p id = 'mp'> ]<br><br>
        However, shipping these packages off to their destinations costs money and can sometimes over turn your profit, 
        resulting in no money gained or even some lost.
        <br><br>To stop this, you can dismiss packages via: <br><br>[ </p>
        <p class= 'blue'>dismiss(</p><p class = 'dull'>package_name</p><p class= 'blue'>)</p>
        <p id = 'mp'> ]<br><br>
        While this saves you money, it can damage your demand meter (also known as reputation).
        <strong>But</strong>, always do this over just ignoring a package, 
        because forgetting to acknowledge a package will cause you to lose way more demand and money.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "large-spacer"></div>
    <div id = "mh">How do you know when to ship a package?</div>
    <div class = "divider"></div>
    <div id = "md">
        <p id ="mp">Once a package is recieved, it has four attributes in it, <br><br>
        [distance, weight, broken (true/false), packaged (true/false)]<br><br>
        You can see what these are for each package using: <br><br>[ </p>
        <p class= 'dull'>package_name.</p><p class = 'blue'>attribute_name</p>
        <p id = 'mp'> ]<br><br>
        A shorter way to see all the attributes of a package is using .all.<br><br>
        If the distance on a package is high, 
        then the package will be more costly to ship. (distance range: 80 - 800)<br>
        If the weight on a package is high, 
        then the package will be more costly to ship. (weight range: 40 - 400)<br>
        If the package is broken, it will damage the demand (reputation) when sent.<br>
        If the package is unpacked, it will also damage the demand (reputation) when sent.<br><br>
        Based on these variables, you must determine if the package is worth sending or not. 
        If you dismiss a package, it only costs $10 and loses 5% reputation.</p>

    <div id = "mh">How do you recover from having a low demand or reputation?</div>
    <div class = "divider"></div>
    <div id = "md">
        <p id = "mp"> There are three ways to raise your demand meter:<br><br>
            1. Send packages to people. Sending packages can increase demand if not broken and packaged.<br><br>
            2. Lower the cost. Lowering the cost of your service raises your demand, 
            because more people can afford it.<br><br>
            3. Open and close the business. Discussed in the section below (other features), 
            you may open and close your business. When closed, 
            you cannot recieve new packages and your money will slowly go down. 
            <strong>But</strong>, your demand meter will constantly rise.<br><br>
